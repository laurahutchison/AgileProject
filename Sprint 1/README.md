Timothy

### Apologies:
null

### Summary of Conversation:
Azure is now set up for us and running test code! Yay! Big issue was that the github had to be owned by the person running the azure site so the github project is now under Laura instead of Gina. Today we have to work on understanding asp.net and how the webpages are going to be developed

### Apologies:

### Summary of Conversation:
Email code working! MySQL is now linked and working with azure. Laura expressed feeling overwhelmed and that the task she had taken on was more than she anticipated, a couple members expressed that they were unsure how to continue with their code when the SQL database tables were not yet implimented. Today some reallocating will take place to ease workload on some, as well as members being assigned new tasks as their stories aren't able to be completed until other tasks are.

29/01/21 Day 4 - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Gina Fenton

### Members Present:
Gina, Shanna, Ema (present but her phone died), Laura, Timothy (late), Michael, Calum, Shaun

### Members Not Present:
null

### Apologies:
Ema's phone died which she was attending on

### Summary of Conversation:
Yesterday was hard for many members, the SQL table stuff and having it parse correctly from the webssite is proving far more work than we anticipated. Without this fundamental part of the program many of the stories will not be able to be checked off as 'done', despite them being functioning in standalone environments. Today we will work to get as much working and shown to the clients at the sprint review, then we will reevaluate how we have conducted this project in preperation for the next sprint.
